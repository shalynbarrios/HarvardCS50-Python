## A Word on Academic Honesty

While these files will help you learn Python structurally and effectively, you should do your best to figure out solutions on your own before taking a look at the entirety of my code. Always ask yourself, "How can I make this better?" or "How else can I solve this?" Investing your time and effort into answering these questions yourself is in my opinion the way to eventual mastery.

Please contact me if you have any questions. If you are a first time student learning Python, I suggest you stop by my Python Neetcode repository. There, I focus on breaking down basic syntax and keywords. Have a great day, learners!
